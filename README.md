# dnd

there are no ad-free dnd character sheet/character creation/spellbook apps. thanks, capitalism. so here's an attempt at that.

relies pretty heavily on www.dnd5eapi.co so shout out to them.

2020-06-21 the project started out with the idea that it would be something i could use on my old pixel c tablet while playing 5e. but then my tablet stopped working, and now we're all stuck inside (thanks coronavirus) so the plan changed a bit and now the intention is to make it something that could be shared for other people to use. so a lot of refactoring and changing is required. so things are going to get messed up and moved around quite a bit. just in case anyone looks at this.
